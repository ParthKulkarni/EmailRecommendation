Hi,
maildrop source tree can be build with different build option to produce
maildrop program in 2 ways for each arch.
 * set GID mail without restricted caller (maildrop)
 * set UID root with restricted caller for courier-mta
   (maildrop-courier) -- This is now missing in archive but we used to
   have it.
Of course we can build 2 source packages to do this.  But is there any
easy clean way to do this without making 2 source packages with
identical upstream tarball.
Any pointer to a simple example which uses autotools as its build script
is appreciated.  (Program example simpler than glibc or linux kernel is
appreciated.)
Regards,
Osamu
