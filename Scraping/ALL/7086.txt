[CCing the uploaders for cdebconf]
Hello,
I would like to add support for a "pkg.cdebconf.nogtk" build-profile
to cdebconf.  Background for that is that cdebconf (in particular
libdebconfclient0) is needed rather early in the process of
bootstrapping a new Debian architecture, but getting it built during
early architecture bootstrap is difficult due to its build-dependency
on gtk+cairo, which pulls in an enormous list of transitive
build-dependencies that are effectively impossible to fullfill in a
bootstrap scenario.
AIUI, the only binary packages built from the cdebconf source package
that actually need gtk+cairo are cdebconf-gtk and cdebconf-gtk-udeb,
and these aren't required during an architecture bootstrap, so the
approach is to add a build-profile that does two things when set:
- disable building of these two binary packages
- remove the gtk+cairo build-dependency
Attached is a patch that implements that. As nothing changes when
the build-profile isn't explicitly activiated, this should be a
low-risc modification, but as I normally don't work on cdebconf, I
would like to gather feedback from the regular uploaders (in CC)
whether you see some reason to object to this change.
The debdiff between a standard build and a build with the
build-profile set is clean; the only difference with the
build-profile enabled is that the gtk-related binary packages
aren't built.
If the patch is ok for you, I'll apply it to cdebconf git and
upload a new version.
Regards,
Karsten

Subject: [PATCH] Add a pkg.cdebconf.nogtk build-profile.
When the pkg.cdebconf.nogtk profile is set, the build-dependency on
gtk and cairo gets removed and the cdebconf-gtk and cdebconf-gtk-udeb
binary packages (which are the only ones actually depending on gtk
and cairo) aren't built.  This is important when bootstrapping a new
architecture as cdebconf is required for building the essential
package set and a dependency on gtk and cairo pulls in an enormous
list of transitive build-dependencies that are effectively impossible
to fullfill in a bootstrap scenario.
