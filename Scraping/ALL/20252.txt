Thank you for expressing so well the cause of the fate for sysvinit in
Debian.  It seem clear its proponents believe everything is OK and no
effort is needed to save sysvinit.  If this continues, sysvinit in
Debian will continue to rot and end up being removed.
I know from maintaining the sysvinit set of packages that it require
work to maintain them.  There are hundreds of open bugs against the
sysvinit packages in Debian already.
