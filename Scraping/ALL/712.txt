I tried hard to reproduce it the same way I was able to reproduce it on Dec 14th. I switched back the relevant sites to HTTP/2 (Protocols h2 http/1.1) and tested in Safari checking web inspector console on a site where previously a bunch of jpg images were not loaded at all.

I need to disappoint you. I was now able to reproduce the same issue under Apache with applied patch.
It was only a Safari browser caching thing why I couldn't reproduce it before. After emptying browser cache the problem occurred again. Switching back to http/1.1 resolves the issue.
So it looks like your patch did not change anything here.
Looking forward for your next trick!
Cheers,
Philip
