Hi,
I'm adding gnupg maintainers in cc since they might have interesting
tips for the implementation. Context: we need to replace apt-key add
calls with dropping files under the appropriate names for extra
repositories in a Debian Installer context.

I've tested with a custom repository and a sid chroot, and results are
as follows when only the said file has been added to trusted.gpg.d/:
| C2B35520.asc with asc contents: OK
| C2B35520.asc with gpg contents: KO
| C2B35520.gpg with gpg contents: OK
| C2B35520.gpg with asc contents: KO
so I think we need to have some kind of autodetection code. gnupg
maintainers: is grepping for “BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK” enough to
decide between armored and non-armored? Or do you have any better
solutions?
