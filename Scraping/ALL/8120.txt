console-setup needs several attempts everytime, 'til it migrates.
The point is, that autopkgtest claims about unmet dependencies for all
archs (packages vidcontrol and kbdcontrol being unavailable).
However, these packages are only existing for kfreebsd.
Why does console-setup depend on it on all archs?
Can the control file be changed for console-setup-freebsd as below?
  Package: console-setup-freebsd
  Section: utils
  Priority: optional
  Architecture: all
  Multi-Arch: foreign
- Depends: vidcontrol, kbdcontrol, keyboard-configuration (= ${source:Version}), ${misc:Depends}, init-system-helpers (>= 1.29~) | initscripts
+ Depends: vidcontrol [kfreebsd-any], kbdcontrol [kfreebsd-any], keyboard-configuration (= ${source:Version}), ${misc:Depends}, init-system-helpers (>= 1.29~) | initscripts
  Suggests: console-setup
  Conflicts: console-setup-linux
  Breaks: console-setup (<< 1.71)
  Replaces: console-setup (<< 1.71)
  Description: FreeBSD specific part of console-setup
   This package includes raw, uuencoded fonts and various screen maps.
console-setup-freebsd is not needed on archs other than kfreebsd, I suspect?
Or am I missing something?
Holger
