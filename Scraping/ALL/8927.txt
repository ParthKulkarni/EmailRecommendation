I made a simple  script which downloads, compiles and installes the zfs
kernel module and zhe zfs,spool commands.
Tested with the stable netinstall iso, after network is configured and
deboostrap is downloaded.
It makes a simple chroot environment, apt-get install zfsutils-linux and
then copies the binaries and the necessary libraries over.
zfs.sh
