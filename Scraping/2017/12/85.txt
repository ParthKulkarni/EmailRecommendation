Not on the version specifics, to be honest.

Maybe it happens only on Windows 7 on SSD? Or only in specific editions?
But a quick web search reveals that Windows 8 was the first Windows to
have "Fast Startup"/"Hybrid Shutdown" enabled per default and Windows 10
has this feature enabled as well.
I mostly deal, if I have to deal, with the server variant of Windows,
which does not have this feature.
But I have seen the NTFS-mount-only-as-RO problem on other peoples
systems, when dual booting into Linux.
