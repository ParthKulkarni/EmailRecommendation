Yeah, but adding more nodes is fortunately easy with jenkins.

The "distributed usage model" in the above service is in gbp-try-ff
already. It relies on having a gbp compatible branch layout at the
moment.

That's true. My main focus is automating one thing: updating to new
upstreams via uscan for packages that already use git as a VCS. The
motivation is to know what amount of work to exepct when doing this (do
patches still apply, does it still build, to tests still pass).
Happy to apply patches to fix up other things as well. In this case we
should indeed use git repos to keep the made changes for easily pulling
these in.
Oh and if you want you package on alioth integrated please send a PR, we
can do so until we run of resources.
Cheer,
