"However, the basic ideas seem like good ones, and I'll look into
adopting these with a less offensive implementation."
Seems like the author liked the concepts behinds the patches, but felt
that the patches needed more work. I think I would have started by
trying to submit a smaller change (e.g. maybe the first patch in the
series).
I don't see any response to this email.
Doesn't inspire confidence :-(
