In my case, there are multiple debian installations and the installer
positions the last installation at the top of the *grub* menu. This
makes sense. But why change the *bios* menu? With the variability in
manufacturers bios code, changing the bios menu seems like a risky,
tricky, and tedious undertaking. AFAICT it's instigated by the
installer and presumably a necessary thing. I've searched for the
rationale, but have missed it, if it's out there. Can you refer me to
something?

That just doesn't seem logical. There was a perfectly good priority,
before installs of Debian, I think it went:
UEFI Boot Sources
  ATAPI CD/DVD Drive
  USB Floppy/CD
  Hard Drive
  USB Hard Drive
Legacy Boot Sources
  ATAPI CD/DVD Drive
  USB Floppy/CD
  Hard Drive
    SATA0
After installing stretch, it changed to:
UEFI Boot Sources
  debian
  ATAPI CD/DVD Drive
  USB Floppy/CD
  USB Hard Drive
Legacy Boot Sources
  [...]
If done by firmware, wouldn't grub or the installer have to tell
the firmware to put "debian" in the bios menu and make it first? In its
past life, this PC ran Windows 7 but in order to boot from mountable
media there was no need for the user to change the boot order.
