I think it is usually `grub-install` which calls `efibootmgr` and it
seems to pass `"-L", efi_distributor` where `efi_distributor` would be
"debian" in the case of grub packaged for Debian.

I suspect there may be a general assumption (I don't mean within Debian
or Grub but in the world at large) that if you install something new
then it is what you want to boot in the future. The vast majority of
systems only boot a single operation system and I could see system
manufacturers and/or consumer OS producers with a lot of clout deciding
that booting from a CD by default is more likely to confuse the average
user than be what they actually wanted and be happy to require
documentation to "Press F?? and choose CD" for the uncommon case.
`efibootmgr` doesn't appear to have any options to control the
placement of the new option within the boot order when using `-c`, only
a separate option to change the order after the fact -- I wonder if
this is actually a property of the UEFI firmware on your system, or
even of the UEFI specification? It seems to me that if such control was
possible at the firmware level then `efibootmgr` would expose it (it is
a pretty low level tool). You could file a wishlist bug against that
package to discuss or you could speak to the `efibootmgr` upstream
about it on their own support channels, I bet they would know for sure
(whereas I think you'd be lucky to find anyone around here who could do
more than speculate as I am doing).
BTW I suspect the "Hard Drive" you saw before you installed was simply
the name either HP or MS chose for "Windows boot loader", in an attempt
to optimise understanding for non-technical people.
It appears that one can use `efibootmgr -o` to reset the boot order to
whatever they like, so if you just want to move on you could use that
to fix things to however you want it.
