The number isn't persistent across reboots, so it would speed up again
on the reboot after the installation finished.

1000 is a nice small number, which I think might make sense as a
default *while* we're installing. Once the installer has finished and
the system is rebooted, all will go back to normal. Hell, we could
even expose this value via debconf for expert (and preseed) if needed.
