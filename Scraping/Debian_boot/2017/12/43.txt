Vagrant images for Virtual Box are still using d-i, if that counts as
cloud image.
However I haven't noted anything problematic using d-i on qemu for what
concerns virtualization/cloud support detection in my use case.
Actually I prefer the installer not too be smart, for instance I am not
sure if I want the installer installing automatically a qemu-guest-agent
package if it detects qemu as the underlying platform.
