Hello,
as we appear to have the same underlying problem in bugs 864536,
864457 and 856111, I personally think that adding the modules
necessary for i2c-support in d-i is worth another upload before
r0, provided the current diagnosis in 864457 is correct and
handling the additional work due to this is doable for everybody
involved.
If the current diagnosis in 864457 is correct, not providing i2c
modules AFAICS will not only break d-i completely on the
Firefly-RK3288 (bug 864536) but also the following usecases:
- all hd-media and thereby all offline installs
- all installations to USB-connected harddisks
- all non-serial-console installations due to non-working
  USB keyboard support
on all systems that use the AXP20x series of powermanagement
controllers, which is a significant part of the armhf platforms
that we provide installer images for:
- A10-OLinuXino-Lime
- A20-OLinuXino-Lime
- A20-OLinuXino-Lime2
- A20-OLinuXino-MICRO
- A20-Olimex-SOM-EVB
- BananaPi
- BananaPro
- Cubieboard
- Cubieboard2
- Cubietruck
- Lamobo_R1
- orangepi_plus
- pcDuino
- pcDuino3
AIUI, the following changes to the kernel package would be
needed:
- add an i2c-modules config for armhf which includes the generic
  i2c-modules config plus the i2c-mv64xxx and i2c-rk3x modules 
- add the axp20x_usb_power module to the armhf kernel-image config
  to address the specifics of bug #856111 (see Ben Hutchings' notes
  at https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=856111#54)
As that effectively only makes the same modules that we already
install on all armhf systems also available inside the d-i
environment, the chances of causing a regression by this change
are rather low.  Size constraints are AFAIK not a problem on
armhf (in contrast to armel), so the aforementioned changes
should be rather low-risk.
Regards,
Karsten
