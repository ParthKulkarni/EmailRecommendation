Attached is a patch to handle all the potentially failing cases. I
tested this by running debootstrap once, wiping everything the target
except /dev, and running debootstrap again. It succeeded. As mentioned
above, an existing device is skipped while the symlinks are forcefully
overwritten. That seems inconsistent, but I'm not sure it matters. I
could easily change the mknod function to forcefully remove, too.

Subject: [PATCH] Handle existing /dev (Closes: #872577)
When devices.tar.gz was being used, the devices would be written into
place with tar. This has the effect that the devices would be merged
into an existing /dev in the target. setup_devices_simple() does not
handle this case and fails when /dev already exists.
Normally, the target would be empty and this wouldn't be an issue.
However, some tools that use debootstrap to initialize a target depended
on the old behavior. In particular, the obs-build package used for OBS
sets up a minimal /dev in the generic prep code before using debootstrap
to install packages needed for building debian packages.
Allow for existing devices, directories and symlinks by skipping
existing devices and directories and forcefully overwriting existing
symlinks.
