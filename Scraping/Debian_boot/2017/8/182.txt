Package: debootstrap
Version: 1.0.89
Severity: normal
Tags: patch
When devices.tar.gz was being used, the devices would be written into
place with tar. This has the effect that the devices would be merged
into an existing /dev in the target. setup_devices_simple() does not
handle this case and fails when /dev already exists.
Normally, the target would be empty and this wouldn't be an issue.
However, some tools that use debootstrap to initialize a target depended
on the old behavior. In particular, the obs-build package used for OBS
sets up a minimal /dev in the generic prep code before using debootstrap
to install packages needed for building debian packages.
The attached patch fixes this by using tar to emulate the old
behavior. It would be really helpful if this could be applied.
Thanks!

Subject: [PATCH] Merge devices to /dev with tar
When devices.tar.gz was being used, the devices would be written into
place with tar. This has the effect that the devices would be merged
into an existing /dev in the target. setup_devices_simple() does not
handle this case and fails when /dev already exists.

However, some tools that use debootstrap to initialize a target depended
on the old behavior. In particular, the obs-build package used for OBS
sets up a minimal /dev in the generic prep code before using debootstrap
to install packages needed for building debian packages.
Emulate the old behavior by creating the devices in a temporary
debootstrap/dev and then use tar to write them into place.
