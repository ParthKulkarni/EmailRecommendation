Please do add that phrase; thus removing any ambiguities and cover the
glaring omission in the Debian documentation.
That clarification will prevent other individuals -- who have
downloaded the netboot installer from SourceForge -- from potentially
reporting via the debian mechanism -- once the installation completes.
Additionally, appending “we don't need reiser4-specific reports” will
be a welcome *explicit* change in policy from other FOSS projects,
like GNU Parted, where the unspoken censorship on reiser4 bites anyone
who submits patches in support of the
'Batman Machine': Reiser4

Again, thank you.
Best Professional Regards.
