dak logs which bug reports is closed when a source package was removed:
see the "Also-Bugs" field in https://ftp-master.debian.org/removals.822
(for the current year; removals-YYYY.822 or removals-full.822 are also
available).
Note that sometimes[1] the bugs are not closed by dak and end up getting
closed in a different way.
