Understood.

There is already the possibility of different package sets, people can
install different desktops or even no desktop using d-i. They can also
add or remove packages after the installation is complete.

That seems reasonable, I guess you should then file a bug against any
tasks that depend on wicd and ask them to switch to NM, but see Jonas'
response.
OTOH the number of use-cases supported by Debian is high.
Does everyone need to access NTFS/HFS+ filesystems?
Does everyone need to access iOS devices?
Does everyone need to interact with LEGO devices?
Does everyone need the app for firing foam missile launchers?

isenkram was primarily developed for the use-case of plugging in
devices and then getting the appropriate software installed and the
device working, my suggestion of adding isenkram to the installer was
primarily so that devices plugged in at install time will always work
on first boot. So isenkram could be both in the installer and in the
installed system.

Debian hasn't yet defined any immutable "standard systems", it might
be interesting to do that and put them in ostree like Endless are
doing:
https://debconf17.debconf.org/talks/41/
That would require some repacking of "apps" .deb files into Flatpaks.
https://debconf17.debconf.org/talks/59/
It is definitely true that each desktop reinvents a lot of wheels, but
some things (like libsecret or gnome-shell or GTK+ or Qt) are shared
between some of them.

The Debian installer doesn't install any Debian derivatives (like
Ubuntu), it only installs subsets of the whole of Debian, but I assume
that "subset" is what you meant by "derivative".
To a small extent the different tasks are already packaged as
different installer images, there is an Xfce installer CD.

This is probably a good thing for new users.
