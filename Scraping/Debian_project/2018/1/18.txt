Others may feel differently, but I'd prefer if you just didn't update
standards version at all for your packages in that case.  I think that
would be fine -- you're indicating that you're not reviewing all changes
to Policy in a systematic way.  Should you have (or later get)
co-maintainers for your package, they'll see that this is something they
could do if they wished and enjoyed that work more than you do.
