 Thing is, just because something is written in a polite way doesn't
mean it can't be hurtful, and just because something comes across
brusquely doesn't mean it might not be justified.  And willy was
extremely clear on not wanting a response, and yet you chose to respond
to it.  So willy's anger towards that is very much justified, and
discussing about that tone is putting the focus on the wrong end here.
Expecting mistreated people to interact constructively about their
mistreatment is a tool of oppression and privilege, which you show in
your other mail:

 That reads a bit like you intentionally ignored the request to not be
contacted again, or simply didn't care, and try to justify with this.
Which is what what I think Chris refers to as victim blaming, that is,
putting the emphasis for the reaction towards your mistreatment on
willy, which you make it read like you don't see anything wrong with,
which is really not cool.
 Please think of your own actions and don't ask others to seek help with
what you have attributed to.
 Fruits for thoughs,
Rhonda
