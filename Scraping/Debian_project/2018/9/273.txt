0.242+git20151019-1 is not <= 0.242+git20151019-1~ so that is
definitely wrong.  Maybe you meant <= 0.242+git20151019-1.1~ ?
But if I were preparing an NMU I would be intending to use
0.242+git20151019-1.1 as the nmu version; and my draft packages would
be called precisely 0.242+git20151019-1.1~ and don't want to be
conflicted against.  Hence  0.242+git20151019-1.1~
This seems like arcane lore really.  Surely this stuff ought to be
documented somewhere ?
