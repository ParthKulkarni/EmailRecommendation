Sometimes the maintainer is wrong, but someone has to decide.  There are 
approximately two choices for who decides:
1.  Maintainer, who knows about the package.
2.  FTP team member, who does not.
I guess, in theory, there's a third choice of some committee that reviews 
these requests before they are referred to the FTP team for action, but I 
think it would be a horrible idea.
There are packages that do fine as QA maintained and there are others that 
really should not be in Debian unless someone is watching over them.  I have 
asked for packages that I maintained to be removed for that reason.  I think 
the maintainer is the best one to make this call.

I agree that it's not a general solution.  I was referring to this specific 
case.
I also think it's difficult for people who don't routinely process rm requests 
to appreciate how rare a controversial removal is.  It almost never happens 
(in the context of the large number of requests that get processed).  
Statistically this is virtually a non-problem.
