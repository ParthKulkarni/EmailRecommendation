Right. I have the exact opposite view: why compile a c++ project using
c++11 flags while it was written for c++98...
You also consider that upstream is active and willing to migrate from
c++98 toward c++11 (for example), I had the exact opposite example in
mind.

I do not see you point clearly. Let me rephrase it then: You would
like to see no explicit -std=c++ in the build logs, so as to guarantee
we always compile a c++ project using whatever default c++ standard is
being used by the current gcc version. Is this a correct rephrasing ?
