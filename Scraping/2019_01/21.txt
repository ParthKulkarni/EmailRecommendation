Hi,
In the past 3½ years, several things have been improved and I am
therefore taking the liberty of closing this bug against general
(remaining issues as I understand it will be in individual packages).
In particular, I think we have identified all major issues, solved most
of them and triaged/assigned the remaining ones.
For individual packages, improvements are often a question of:
 * Migrating to "Rules-Requires-Root: no" where possible.
 * Avoid calling dpkg-parsechangelog directly and instead use dpkg's
   makefile snippets.
 * Replace "comment only" override targets with completely empty
   override targets.
(Not necessarily listed in order of "best performance for value" as that
depends on exactly what the package does)

This issue is still prevalent but we now have support for reducing the
number of calls to debian/rules, which is "opt-in" for packages at the
moment.
With "Rules-Requires-Root: no" (recently added to policy), you can
remove two debian/rules invocation on the dpkg side and one on the dh
side.  Which brings us down to:
  * 2 calls from dpkg (one for clean and one for the binary target)
  * 2+N calls for dh to probe the rules file for override targets plus
    the N (non-empty) overrides a package might have.

I believe this has been fixed now.

Lintian now flags use of dpkg-parsechangelog in most cases and
recommends people to migrate to the optimized makefile snippets in dpkg.

This has not been implemented.  However, debhelper has implemented two
features to improve performance here:
 * debhelper now uses the Dpkg module internally instead of forking
   dpkg-parsechangelog, which reduces a bit of runtime.
 * debhelper now caches the result from d/changelog so we at most parse
   that file once per helper needs to know the version ($dh{VERSION}).
   (Down from "one per binary package built per helper needing
   $dh{VERSION}")
In the default sequence, the only (non-error) case of $dh{VERSION}
appears in dh_makeshlibs in the -VUpstream-Version case (which is the
default).  Thus only source packages with shared libraries are affected
(there is considerably amount of those but it is far from "every package").

To my knowledge, Guillem has implemented an improvement that makes the
default case faster.
