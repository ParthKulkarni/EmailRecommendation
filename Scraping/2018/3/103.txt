Sspecifically in vtk7 there are two main issues, one is that in nearly
all files the main copyright header is 
  Copyright (c) Ken Martin, Will Schroeder, Bill Lorensen
  All rights reserved.
  See Copyright.txt or http://www.kitware.com/Copyright.htm for 
  details.
     This software is distributed WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even
     the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A ARTICULAR
     PURPOSE.  See the above copyright notice for more information.
Which means licensecheck will report an unknown license, and one has to
check what is actually written in these files. Copyright.txt is then
simply a BSD-3 clause license, but obviously one has to check.
The second issue is that there are often two or more distinct copyright
notices in different blocks with different statements, think variations
of: 
  
 Copyright 2008 Sandia Corporation.
 Under the terms of Contract DE-AC04-94AL85000 with Sandia Corporation,
 the U.S. Government retains certain rights in this software.

 See Copyright.txt or http://www.kitware.com/Copyright.htm for details.
Another licenses that is not recognized is
