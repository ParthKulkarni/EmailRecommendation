It seems ftp masters are literally the masters with only a GR powerful
enough to over turn their decisions. See
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=881339#55
I do not think this is really in sync with the rest of debian
philosophy. I think the following steps would improve the situation.
1. If a single ftp master is in disagreement, there should be a team
decision (in previous cases of disagreement also, other team members did
not get involved).
2. CTTE should be able to overrule a delegate when there is a conflict
just like conflict between two debian developers.
