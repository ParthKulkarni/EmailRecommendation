Text from that webpage
    LemonLDAP::NG is an open source Web Single Sign On (WebSSO), Access
    Management and Identity Federation product, written in Perl and
    Javascript.
    LemonLDAP::NG is a free software, released under GPL license.
    LemonLDAP::NG is the first SSO software deployed in French
    administrations. It can handle large-scale organization (tested with
    hundreds of thousands users). Many private firms use it too.
